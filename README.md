# Welcome to OOP244 repository #

**OOP244** is a programming course [@Seneca](http://www.senecacollege.ca/ce/classes/OOP244.html)

*Keep in mind that I had winter 2017 course. Thus, content of the this repository could be outdated.*

---

### Warning

I injected pure C++ in my brain every single day for the full duration of the course!
```C++
#include <iostream>

void main(){
    std::cout << "C++ is awesome! I like it!";
}
```
*So, some coding solution you find in my code are not recommended to use and can cause brain damage.*

**Always consult your doctor before beginning any serious coding**.
